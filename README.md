# üí§ LazyVim (Golang + Flutter + Dart + WSL)

## Why?

There are my favourite plugins and settings, in future I'll also extend it with snippets
I am working on multiple devices so it's great to sync configs between.

Also, I love the idea of actually OWNING software
Instead of paying each month (I am Jetbrains user since ~10 years)

## Quickstart

## How to?

It's tested tested with

- Os X with M1 Pro (ARM)
- Windows WSL (Ubuntu)

### Pre-requirements

- First of all install `neovim`
- `git`
- `curl`
- `rust` with `cargo` package manager
- `tree-sitter` (Should be shipped with neovim and available from your `$PATH`)

### If you're using WSL

Clipboard wont work unless you'll configure it.
The required configs are already in this repo, so you'll need to install [Win32Yank]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page#modifying-front-matter](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank/releases))
Just download release and unpack into place where your windows **$PATH** is configure.

## Troubleshoting

### General

Use `:LazyHealth` and resolve at least problems.
In ideal scenario also warnings for the most optimal results
(PS. I don't recommend updating mason, let's stick with what lazyvim offers as long as it does the job)

### Windows WSL

Often it's that bin points into .exe instead of linux executable

#### Copy and Paste works only inside of nvim

For example you've copied text from your windows chrome, and you can't paste inside of nvim using `p`

##### Assuming you've already installed win32yank.exe

Open windows terminal (without WSL) and type win32yank.exe - if it was not found, google how to setup **$PATH** on windows
PS. Remember to fully restart terminal

### Nvim points to bins from windows like go.exe or dart.exe

WSL adds *windows* $PATH into your *linux* $PATH because thru WSL you can run .exe - often it's problematic
Simplest solution which I've found is to install desired tool on WSL.
Then check `which dart` or `which go` or any other tool
If it points into something like ‚ùå`/mnt/c/...`‚ùå then you'll need to edit your $PATH
I've searched .profile .zshrc and .bashrc but didn't find $PATH
So easies way is to add something like this to you bash profile:

`PATH=$(REMOVE_PART="/mnt/c/flutter/bin" sh -c 'echo ":$PATH:" | sed "s@:$REMOVE_PART:@:@g;s@^:\(.*\):\$@\1@"')`

## Installation

### Backup config (optional)

Skip if you don't care

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```

### Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:marosiak/lazyvim-go-dart.git ~/.config/nvim
```

## Updating

### Update my configs

`cd ~/.config/nvim && git pull`

### Update plugins versions

Open nvim, go into Lazy tab and sync

## Languages

### Golang

#### Keymaps

Press `<leader>cg` in order to see extra features, for now just a few, but there are more LSP oriented just in `<leader>c`

- ![Img](./img/gopher-keybinds.png)

#### Go Commands

Common ones: `:GoBuild` `:GoRun` `:GoStop` `:GoTest` `:GoCoverage`
You can close appearing terminal with `GoTermClose` or just `<leader>w` (basically use window navigations)

### Flutter & Dart

Full description: <https://github.com/nvim-flutter/flutter-tools.nvim>

#### Flutter commands

Common commands: `:FlutterRun` `:FlutterDevices` `:FlutterQuit` (and more)
and my favourite: `:FlutterOutlineOpen`
